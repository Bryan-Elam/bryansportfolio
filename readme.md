 # Bryan's Portfolio Site
 
 This is my _Code Louisville_ front-end project, a resume/portfolio site, where I can: 
 
 * Put links to any future repositories 
 * Keep an updated resume
 * Provide links for potential employers to contact me 
 or view my work on github and codepen
 


# Required Features:
1. Media Queries that change content based on screen size.
2. Using git regularly to upload commits.
3. readme.md

## CSS Features:
1.  A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

2. Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. _Hamburger spins into an X_

3. Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.
_ul nav_list flexbox container changes from column in mobile to row in larger screens_
_resume.html uses grid to change from one column in mobile view, to two and then three columns in larger views.

## JavaScript Features:
1. Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code. | _Hamburger Button opens menu, clicking either the Hamburger X or a link slides the menu away._

2. Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value to do something on the site.
_On Portfolio page, link to a seperate repository, which is a form I built, which takes user input numbers, and accurately converts Celsius in Fahrenheit or nautical miles into miles_
